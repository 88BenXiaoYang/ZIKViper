/**
 Abstract superclass for router that can perform route and remove route.
 @discussion
 Features:
 
 1. Prepare the route with protocol in block, instead of directly configuring the destination (the source is coupled with the destination if you do this) or in delegate method (in -prepareForSegue:sender: you have to distinguish different destinations, and they're alse coupled with source).
 
 2. Specify a router with generic and protocol, then you can hide subclass but still can get routers with different functions.
 
 See sample code in ZIKServiceRouter and ZIKViewRouter for more detail.
