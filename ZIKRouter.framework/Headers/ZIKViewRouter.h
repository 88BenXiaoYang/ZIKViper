 The view router can perform all navigation types in UIKit through one method. Subclass it and implement ZIKViewRouterProtocol to make router of your view.
 @discussion
 Features:
 
 1. Prepare the route with protocol in block, instead of directly configuring the destination (the source is coupled with the destination) or in delegate method (in -prepareForSegue:sender: you have to distinguish different destinations, and they're alse coupled with source).
 
 2. Support all route types in UIKit, and can remove the destination without using -popViewControllerAnimated:/-dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:/removeFromParentViewController/removeFromSuperview in different sistuation. Router can choose the proper method. You can alse add custom route type.
 
 3. Find destination with registered protocol, decoupling the source with and the destination class.
 
 4. Support storyboard. UIViewController and UIView from a segue can auto create it's registered router (but the initial view controller of app is exceptional, it's not from a segue).
 
 5. Enough error checking for route action.
 
 6. AOP support for destination's route action.
 
 Method swizzle declaration:
 
 What did ZIKViewRouter hooked: -willMoveToParentViewController:, -didMoveToParentViewController:, -viewWillAppear:, -viewDidAppear:, -viewWillDisappear:, -viewDidDisappear:, -viewDidLoad, -willMoveToSuperview:, -didMoveToSuperview, -willMoveToWindow:, -didMoveToWindow, all UIViewControllers' -prepareForSegue:sender:, all UIStoryboardSegues' -perform.
 
 ZIKViewRouter hooks these methods for AOP. -willMoveToSuperview, -willMoveToWindow:, -prepareForSegue:sender: will detect if the view is registered with a router, and auto create a router if it's not routed from it's router.
 
 About auto create:
 
 When a UIViewController is registered, and is routing from storyboard segue, a router will be auto created to prepare the UIViewController. If the destination needs preparing, the segue's performer is responsible for preparing in delegate method -prepareForDestinationRoutingFromExternal:configuration:. But if a UIViewController is routed from code manually, ZIKViewRouter won't auto create router, only get AOP notify, because we can't find the performer to prepare the destination. So you should avoid route the UIViewController instance from code manually, if you use a router as a dependency injector for preparing the UIViewController. You can check whether the destination is prepared in those AOP delegate methods.
 
 When Adding a registered UIView by code or xib, a router will be auto created. We search the view controller with custom class (not system class like native UINavigationController, or any container view controller) in it's responder hierarchy as the performer. If the registered UIView needs preparing, you have to add the view to a superview in a view controller before it removed from superview. There will be an assert failure if there is no view controller to prepare it (such as: 1. add it to a superview, and the superview is never added to a view controller; 2. add it to a UIWindow). If your custom class view use a routable view as it's subview, the custom view should use a router to add and prepare the routable view, then the routable view don't need to search performer because it already prepared.

 4 situation can't remove:
 
 1. Router is not performed yet.
 
 2. Destination was already poped/dismissed/removed/dealloced.
 
 3. Use ZIKViewRouteTypeCustom and the router didn't provide removeRoute, or -canRemoveCustomRoute return NO.
 
 4. If route type is adaptative type, it will choose different presentation for different situation (ZIKViewRouteTypePerformSegue, ZIKViewRouteTypeShow, ZIKViewRouteTypeShowDetail). Then if it's real route type is not Push/PresentModally/PresentAsPopover/AddAsChildViewController, destination can't be removed.
 
 5. Router was auto created when a destination is displayed and not from storyboard, so router don't know destination's state before route, and can't analyze it's real route type to do corresponding remove action.
 
 6. Destination's route type is complicated and is considered as custom route type. Such as destination is added to a UITabBarController, then added to a UINavigationController, and finally presented modally. We don't know the remove action should do dismiss or pop or remove from it's UITabBarController.
 
 @note Router should be removed be the performer, but not inside the destination. Only the performer knows how the destination was displayed (situation 6).
