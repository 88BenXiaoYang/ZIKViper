/**
 Abstract superclass for view router.
 The view router can perform all navigation types in UIKit through one method. Subclass it and implement ZIKViewRouterProtocol to make router of your view. Then use generic with protocol or those dynamic discovering functions to reduce couple with subclasses.
 @discussion
 Features:
 
 1. Support all route types in UIKit, and can remove the destination without using -popViewControllerAnimated:/-dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:/removeFromParentViewController/removeFromSuperview in different sistuation. Router can choose the proper method. You can alse add custom route type.
 
 2. Support storyboard. UIViewController and UIView from a segue can auto create it's registered router.
 
 3. Enough error checking for route action.
 
 4. AOP support for destination's route action.
 
 Method swizzle declaration:
 
 What did ZIKViewRouter hooked: -willMoveToParentViewController:, -didMoveToParentViewController:, -viewWillAppear:, -viewDidAppear:, -viewWillDisappear:, -viewDidDisappear:, -viewDidLoad, -willMoveToSuperview:, -didMoveToSuperview, -willMoveToWindow:, -didMoveToWindow, all UIViewControllers' -prepareForSegue:sender:, all UIStoryboardSegues' -perform.
 
 ZIKViewRouter hooks these methods for AOP. -willMoveToSuperview, -willMoveToWindow:, -prepareForSegue:sender: will detect if the view is registered with a router, and auto create a router if it's not routed from it's router.
 
 About auto create:
 
 When a UIViewController conforms to ZIKRoutableView, and is routing from storyboard segue or from -instantiateInitialViewController, a router will be auto created to prepare the UIViewController. If the destination needs preparing, the segue's performer is responsible for preparing in delegate method -prepareDestinationFromExternal:configuration:. But if a UIViewController is routed from code manually, ZIKViewRouter won't auto create router, only get AOP notify, because we can't find the performer to prepare the destination. So you should avoid route the UIViewController instance from code manually, if you use a router as a dependency injector for preparing the UIViewController. You can check whether the destination is prepared properly in those AOP delegate methods.
 
 When Adding a registered UIView by code or xib, a router will be auto created. We search the view controller with custom class (not system class like native UINavigationController, or any container view controller) in it's responder hierarchy as the performer. If the registered UIView needs preparing, you have to add the view to a superview in a view controller before it removed from superview. There will be an assert failure if there is no view controller to prepare it (such as: 1. add it to a superview, and the superview is never added to a view controller; 2. add it to a UIWindow). If your custom class view use a routable view as it's subview, the custom view should use a router to add and prepare the routable view, then the routable view don't need to search performer because it's already prepared.

 3. Use ZIKViewRouteTypeCustom and the router didn't provide removeRoute, or -canRemoveCustomRoute return NO.
 
 4. If route type is adaptative type, it will choose different presentation for different situation (ZIKViewRouteTypePerformSegue, ZIKViewRouteTypeShow, ZIKViewRouteTypeShowDetail). Then if it's real route type is not Push/PresentModally/PresentAsPopover/AddAsChildViewController, destination can't be removed.
 
 5. Router was auto created when a destination is displayed and not from storyboard, so router don't know destination's state before route, and can't analyze it's real route type to do corresponding remove action.
 
 6. Destination's route type is complicated and is considered as custom route type. Such as destination is added to a UITabBarController, then added to a UINavigationController, and finally presented modally. We don't know the remove action should do dismiss or pop or remove from it's UITabBarController.
